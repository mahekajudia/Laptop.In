# Laptop.In

Laptop.in was my Web-Technology subject's mini-project. It was based on all the technologies for front and back end side of the website. But due to github do not host backend side of the website i decided to upload just the front-side of the website. 

I suggest you to pull/download this repository and see what i have created. Please contribute any changes that you think it will be benificial to the website by this help me learn the web-development. 

thank you
keep coding
